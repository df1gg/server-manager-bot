# Security Policy

This project takes security seriously. Please read below for how we handle vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it privately:

- **Email:** dffgee4@gmail.com

When you contact us, please include:

1. A clear description of the vulnerability  
2. Steps or proof-of-concept to reproduce  
3. Any relevant logs, screenshots or sample code  

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days. Once resolved, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability (unless you request otherwise).
